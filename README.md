# this is my final project of 'Databases' using SQL
# Sales Database Project

This repository contains the code and presentation for a **Database Final Project** focused on managing a sales dataset using SQL. The project demonstrates skills in database design, SQL querying, and relational data operations.

## Project Overview
The project involves a sales database (`multi_datasets`) with **9 tables** to store information about customers, orders, products, stores, staff, and more. The accompanying presentation (`Presentation1.pdf`) outlines the database structure, SQL queries, and results.

### Key Features
- **Database Setup**: Created a database and tables with appropriate primary and foreign keys.
- **SQL Queries**:
  - Data retrieval using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `LIMIT`, `DISTINCT`, `LIKE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, etc.
  - Data modification with `UPDATE` statements.
  - Aggregations like `COUNT`, `AVG`, and `ROUND`.
- **Joins**: Implemented `INNER`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `FULL`, and `SELF` joins to combine data from multiple tables.
- **ER Diagram and Schema**: Planned for visualization (not included in the provided slides).

### Presentation Highlights
- **Tables Created**: Examples include `stocks`, `staffs`, `order_items`, and `departments`.
- **Query Examples**:
  - Filtering customers by name patterns.
  - Retrieving top 10 brands or categories.
  - Updating customer records.
  - Joining tables to display order details with customer and store information.
- **Results**: Query outputs are shown in result grids for clarity.

## Repository Contents
- `Presentation1.pdf`: The main presentation detailing the project.

## How to Use
1. **View the Presentation**: Open `Presentation1.pdf` to understand the project structure and see SQL query examples with results.
2. **Run SQL Code**: Use a SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to execute the table creation and query scripts.
3. **Explore Queries**: Review the SQL queries in the presentation to understand data retrieval, modification, and joins.
